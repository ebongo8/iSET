# iSET

**Intelligent Systems Engineering and Testing (iSET)**

This repository is designed as a framework to host and test multiple types of **deep neural networks (DNNs)** across various tasks. Currently, it includes a **supervised learning model for handwritten digit classification using MNIST**, implemented in PyTorch [1].

For a detailed description, usage instructions, and testing information for the MNIST supervised learning model, please see the dedicated README in the `Handwritten Digit Classification` folder:

```
/Handwritten Digit Classification/README.md
```

Future updates may include additional DNN models (e.g., unsupervised, reinforcement learning, or counterfactual reasoning models) integrated into this framework.
